*A hub for one world, a spawn for each world!*

## Project info

HubThat is a Bukkit/SpigotMC plugin that allows players to manage
different spawn points in multiple worlds, and connects all
worlds together through a hub. This is useful to emulate a
small-scale network, where players can play different game modes
in different sub-servers - which in this case, are worlds.  
  
Spawn points can also be grouped and shared through different
worlds. Every message is configurable and the plugin also
includes features such as teleportation cool-downs (useful for
PvP) and Multiverse-Core support.  
  
## Configuration

Full configuration information and setup guide can be found
on the official [SpigotMC forum thread](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hubthat.1166/).
